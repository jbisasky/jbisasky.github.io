A Baltimore, Maryland native, I rode into the world of web development on
the Angular wave in 2015. Soon after realizing Angular is merely
a Javascript framework and not a verb that solves all problems, I have spent the
past year cramming about 15 years of "Web 2.0". I primarily have focused on the
MEAN stack with Gulp as my preferred task builder.
