I have threatened to build a full stack application from the ground up for at
least the past 6 months. I have gone through a lot of tutorials but I really
need to start work on an application that is an amalgamation of what I have
learned. Unfortunately, the rare times I sit down and commit to starting, I
turn into Hal from Malcolm in the Middle fixing a lightbulb...

My most recent distraction was reading Google Jake Knapp's Google Venture
[Sprint Book]. That turned into reading the [Invision blog]. Then installing
trial versions of [Photoshop CC] and [Sketch App]. Somewhere in there I took a
look at the [Material Design spec].

So I have decided to chronicle building an application starting with the
concept and hopefully concluding with a finished (or close enough to finished)
application.

<!--You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
